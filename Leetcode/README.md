# LeetCode Notes

âœ¨ Hi, I'm Noelle! I'm currently learning software engineering and preparing for internships in SWE.

This folder contains my personal notes and solutions for LeetCode problems, written in Python.

To stay focused and consistent, I'm following the **UMPIRE framework** (from [CodePath](https://github.com/CodePath))) to structure my approach, especially for interview preparation.



## UMPIRE Framework

### U â€“ Understand  
- Ask clarifying questions to confirm the problem requirements  
- Define expected input/output formats and constraints  
- Consider happy path and edge case examples

### M â€“ Match  
- Identify the underlying pattern (e.g., sliding window, binary search, fast/slow pointers)  
- Classify the problem into a category (e.g., arrays, graphs, linked lists)

### P â€“ Plan  
- Draft pseudocode and break down key logic  
- Choose appropriate data structures (e.g., stack, hash map)

### I â€“ Implement  
- Code the solution in Python  
- Use meaningful variable names and consistent formatting

### R â€“ Review  
- Dry run the solution with sample inputs  
- Debug step-by-step to ensure correctness

### E â€“ Evaluate  
- Analyze time and space complexity  
- Discuss trade-offs and possible optimizations
