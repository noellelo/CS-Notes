# Leetcode 0015 - 3Sum

## ☀️ UMPIRE

- **Understand**:
  Given an integer array `nums`, return all unique triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that:
  - `i != j`, `i != k`, `j != k`
  - `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`
  - Triplets must not be repeated in the answer

- **Match**:
  This is a good fit for **Two Pointers + Sorting**.
  After sorting the array, we can fix one number and use a two-pointer approach to find the remaining two that sum to a specific target.

- **Plan**:
  - Sort the array
  - Loop over each number `i` (fixing one number)
  - Use two pointers `l = i + 1` and `r = len(nums) - 1` to find two values such that the sum of the three is zero
  - Skip duplicates at `i`, `l`, and `r`
  - Add valid triplets to the result list

- **Implement**: See code section below

- **Review**:
  - Ensure duplicates are skipped using `while` loops after a match is found
  - Check early termination condition (`nums[i] > 0 → break`)

- **Evaluate**:
  - Time: O(n^2)
  - Space: O(1) if not counting result list

## ☀️ Why This Is a Two Pointers Problem

After sorting the array, we fix one element and look for two others that sum to `-nums[i]`. Instead of using three nested loops (O(n^3)), we reduce the problem using two pointers:
- Start with `l = i + 1`, `r = len(nums) - 1`
- Move `l` and `r` based on whether the sum is too small, too large, or just right

This two-pointer strategy allows us to search in linear time for each fixed `i`, resulting in **O(n^2)** total complexity.

## ☀️ Why We Skip Duplicates

We skip duplicate values at multiple stages to avoid repeated triplets:
- At `i`: to avoid starting with the same value multiple times (e.g., `[-1, -1, 2]` twice)
- At `l` and `r`: after a valid triplet is found, skip over all repeated `nums[l]` and `nums[r]`

> Example:
```python
nums = [-2, 0, 0, 0, 2]
```
- When `i = 0 (nums[i] = -2)`, `l = 1`, `r = 4`
- Total sum = 0 → Add `[-2, 0, 2]`
- Then `l += 1` multiple times to skip the duplicate 0s
- This ensures only one instance of the triplet is added

## ☀️ For vs While Loop Choice

- `for` is used for the outer loop over index `i` since the index range is well-defined and increasing
- `while` is used for inner pointer movement when skipping duplicates because we need **manual control** over `l` and `r`
  - e.g., `while l < r and nums[l] == nums[l + 1]: l += 1`
- This allows us to handle **pointer movement and duplicate skipping** elegantly

## ☀️ Edge Case Notes

| Input              | Description                                  | Expected      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `[0, 0, 0]`        | All elements same, only one valid triplet     | `[[0,0,0]]`   |
| `[]`               | Empty list                                   | `[]`          |
| `[1, 2, -2, -1]`   | No possible triplet summing to 0              | `[]`          |
| `[0, 0, 0, 0]`     | Multiple duplicates, should return one triplet| `[[0,0,0]]`   |

## ☀️ Code (Two Pointers)

```python
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Sort the array to enable the two-pointer approach
        nums.sort()
        answer = []

        # Fix the first number and use two pointers to find the other two
        for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
            # Skip duplicates for the first number
            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
                continue

            # Since the array is sorted, if the current number > 0,
            # all numbers after it will also be > 0 → cannot sum to zero
            if nums[i] > 0:
                break

            # Initialize two pointers
            l = i + 1
            r = len(nums) - 1

            while l < r:
                total = nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r]

                if total < 0:
                    l += 1
                elif total > 0:
                    r -= 1
                else:
                    # Found a valid triplet
                    answer.append([nums[i], nums[l], nums[r]])

                    # Skip duplicates around left and right
                    while l < r and nums[l] == nums[l + 1]:
                        l += 1
                    while l < r and nums[r] == nums[r - 1]:
                        r -= 1

                    # Move both pointers
                    l += 1
                    r -= 1

        return answer
```

## ☀️ Coding Walkthrough Script 

First, I sort the input array so I can use the two-pointer method.
If the fixed number is greater than 0, I break early — no future combination can sum to 0.
Then I start a for loop fixing the first number, and skip it if it's a duplicate.
I set two pointers: `l` at `i + 1` and `r` at the end.
I move the pointers inward depending on the total: if the sum is too small, move `l`; too big, move `r`.
When I find a match, I store the triplet and skip all duplicate `l` and `r` values.
Finally, I move both pointers and continue until `l < r` no longer holds.

## ☀️ Brute Force vs Two Pointers

| Method       | Time Complexity           | Space Complexity | Notes                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Brute Force  | O(n^3)                    | O(1)             | Triple nested loops, very slow              |
| Two Pointers | O(n log n + n^2) = O(n^2) | O(1)             | Sort once, then linear scan per fixed index |

Two pointers avoid the third loop by using sorted order to guide the search.
