# Java Notes

âœ¨ Hi, I'm Yulo! I'm currently reviewing core Java concepts as part of my preparation for software engineering roles.

This folder includes my notes, exercises, and mini-experiments in Java â€” from basic syntax to object-oriented programming and common coding patterns.

This is not intended as a software project repo, but rather a clean record of foundational Java practice.

## Topics Covered

- Java syntax and data types
- Conditionals, loops, and arrays
- Array transformations and sorting/searching algorithms
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Interfaces, inheritance, abstract classes
- Exception handling (try/catch, input mismatch, zero division)
- Simple console-based Java projects
